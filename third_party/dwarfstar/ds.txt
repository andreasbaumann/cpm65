DwarfStar was written by Ivo van
Poorten in September 2024, based on
"Build your Own Text Editor" [1] which
was in turn based on antirez's kilo
editor [2].

Several improvements were made to
reduce the amount of screen redrawing,
making it suitable for slow screens,
being either memory based or over a
serial terminal line.  DwarfStar was
first called 'lb' (short for pound,
circa half a kilo) but as more features
were added, mimicking the legendary
WordStar, and its size growing well
beyond what could reasonably called a
pound, it was renamed DwarfStar. As of
this writing cloc reports 626 lines of
code. With syntax highlighting removed,
but several features added, this is
still well below the size of 'kilo'.
